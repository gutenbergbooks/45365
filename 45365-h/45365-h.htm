natur diskovering her mistake. Tha weigh more, akordin tu their heft,
than enny other kreetur, except a crowbar. Tha kant hear enny quicker,
nor further than the hoss, yet their ears are big enuff for snow shoes.
You kan trust them with enny one whose life aint worth enny more than
the mules. The only wa tu keep them into a paster, is tu turn them
into a medder jineing, and let them jump out. Tha are reddy for use,
just as soon as they will du tu abuse. Tha haint got enny friends, and
will live on huckel berry brush, with an ockasional chanse at Kanada
thissels. Tha are a modern invenshun, i dont think the Bible deludes tu
them at tall. Tha sel for more money than enny other domestik animile.

wont heal. If tha ever die tha must kum rite tu life agin, for i never
herd nobody sa "ded mule." Tha are like sum men, very korrupt at harte;
ive known them tu be good mules for 6 months, just tu git a good chanse
to kick sumbody. I never owned one, nor never mean to, unless there is
a United Staits law passed, requiring it. The only reason why tha are
pashunt, is bekause tha are ashamed ov themselfs. I have seen eddikated
mules in a sirkus. Tha kould kick, and bite, tremenjis. I would not sa
what I am forced tu sa again the mule, if his birth want an outrage,
and man want tu blame for it. Enny man who is willing tu drive a mule,
ought to be exempt by law from running for the legislatur. Tha are the
strongest creeturs on earth, and heaviest, ackording tu their sise; I
herd tell ov one who fell oph from the tow path, on the Eri kanawl, and
sunk as soon as he touched bottom, but he kept rite on towing the boat
tu the nex stashun, breathing thru his ears, which stuck out ov the
water about 2 feet 6 inches; i did'nt see this did, but an auctioneer
told me ov it, and i never knew an auctioneer tu lie unless it was
absolutely convenient.</p>

<p>I kum to the conclusion, lately, that life waz so onsartin, that the
only wa for me tu stand a fair chance with other folks, was to git my
life insured, and so i kalled on the Agent of the "Garden Angel life
insurance Co.," and answered the following questions, which waz put tu
me over the top ov a pair of goold specks, by a slik little fat old
feller, with a little round gray head, and az pretty a little belly on
him az enny man ever owned:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>5th&mdash;What iz yure legal opinion ov the constitutionality ov the 10

<p>7th&mdash;Are you married and single, or are yu a Bachelor?</p>

<p>8th&mdash;Do yu beleave in a futer state? if yu du, state it.</p>

can it be did successfully?</p>

<p>10th&mdash;Hav yu ever committed suiside, and if so, how did it seem to
affect yu?</p>

<p>After answering the above questions, like a man in the confirmatif, the
slik little fat old fellow with goold specks on, ced I was insured for

and smiled one ov my moste pensive smiles.</p>

<p class="ph4">FEMALE EDDIKASHUN.</p>


<p>Thare iz so mutch ced about the importanze ov female eddikashun, now a
daze, that a near-sighted person wud suppoze that wimmin was running
tu waist. The more that wimmin ar elevated, the more men ar histed
up too, so tha sa, and them who maik this statement, ain't fur from
out ov the wa fur men hav bin clus after the wimmin, ever sinse humin
beins waz perpetrated. Dear reader, dear, don't be maid a fool uv, by
beleaving for the space ov a half-grown seckond, that Josh Billings,
(more properly Joshua Billings, Esq.,) don't love, respeck, adore, and
worship the sex, and ain't willing tu fite, even with the belly-ake
onto him, two hundred pounds ov any kind ov man, in behalf ov enny
vartuous, and worthy, or even good-looking woman.</p>

<p>I beleave in femail eddikashun, clear up tu the handle, provided
the woman hankers for it, but if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> she don't hanker for it, i kant
see why she shud be histed up into a posishun, where men has got to
cease luving her, just in proposhun az tha are asked to wonder at
her. Tha tell us that thare aint enny posishun that man kan fill, but
what wimmin kan fill it tu; but iz that enny reson why it iz best to
prove it. I haven't enny doubt, that you could eddicate wimmin so
muchly, that tha wouldn't kno enny more about getting dinner, than
sum ministers ov the gospil kno about preaching, and while tha mite
translate one ov Virgils ecklogs tu a spot, tha couldn't translate a
baby out ov a kradle, without letting it cum apart.</p>

<p>I hold that natur haz its laws and programmy, all the wa down, from
the biling over ov a volkano tu the wiggle ov a lam's tale.&mdash;Suppose
you shud take 100 yung injuns and eddikate them tu the highest
pint, and then turn them luce! 95 ov them wud throw a blanket ontu
their shoulders, bid fair-well tu civilizashun, and dive intu the
wildnerness; the uther 5 wud wander about among the pail faces, az far
from hum az a Bufferlo wud be among a herd ov short tailed durhams.
I believe in femail eddikashun, but i had ruther a woman cud beet me
nussing a baby than tu feel that she cud beet me or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> enny other man in
a stump speech or a lektur on veteranara praktiss.</p>

<p>If Billings understands human natur, and he thinks he duz, thare aint
nothing that a true woman luvs more than the hole ov a man's harte;
and, in order tu git this, she haz got tu kno less than he duz, or maik
him think so. I thank the lord that thare aint menny wimmin in the
wurld who want tu know evry thing. I kalkerlate that 9 out ov evry 10
ov the wimmin who luv their huzbands and glory in their children, will
sa that tha had ruther be looked down upon in luving tenderniss than tu
be looked up tu in silent aw.</p>

<p>If Josh Billings haz ced a wurd, in what he haz now rit, wich iz
kalkulated tu damp the arder ov one single aspirin' woman, he iz reddy
tu shed tears, but i hav alwus thort that the very highly eddikated
wimmin work best in single harniss. In konklusion, i sa, elevate the
wimmin, but if their heds and their hartes bekum antagonicks in the
operashun, i shall continner tu think that luv, swapped for wizdom, iz
a doutful gain to the wimmin and a pozatif loss to us poor mail-claid
devils. Mi christian friends, ajew!</p>

<p class="ph4">FRIENDLY LETTER.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Friend Elias</span>:&mdash;You ask me menny questions about the draft that
bothers me. It iz curis how it duz act, but it waz jist so in scripter
times, "2 wimmin waz at a mill a grinding (corn i reckon), one waz
took, and t'other want took." There aint enny dout but the draft iz
for 3 years, or thereabouts, but i think a person would hav a rite to
sell out hiz chanse at enny time during the 3 years, or thereabouts,
for a premium, provided he could show tu the government that he waz
conscientzly oppozed tu hard tak and bilyus fever.</p>

<p>Again: Aleyens aint liable for the draft, espeshila if tha cum from the
city ov Ireland, and hav bin in the habit, for the laste 5 years, ov
voting the democratic ticket.</p>

<p>Againly: Widder-wimmin, and their only son iz exempt, provided the
widder's husband haz alreddy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> sarved 2 years in the war, and iz willing
tu go agin, i beleave the supreme corte haz desided this thing forever.</p>

<p>Onse more: If a drafted man shud run awa with hiz draft, he proberly
wouldn't ever be allowed to stand a draft agin, this looks severe at
fust site, but the more yu look at it, the more yu can see the wisdom
into it.</p>

<p>Onse morely: Xempts are thoze who hav bin drafted into the stait
prizzen, for triing tu git an honest living bi supporting 2 wives at
onst; also, all them people who are crazee, and unsound on the goose;
also, all nusepaper korrespondents and fools in general.</p>

<p>Onse morely again: No substidude will be acksepted, who iz less than
3, or more than 10 feet high, he must know how to chaw terbacker and
drink whiskee, and must'nt be afeered ov the itch nor the rebels. Moral
Karakter aint required, the government furnishes that, and rashuns.</p>

<p>Conclusively: No person kan be drafted but twice in 2 different plases
without hiz consent, but awl men haz a rite tu be drafted at least
onst; i don't think even a rit ov habus corpus could deprive a man ov
this laste, blessed privlege.</p>

<p class="ph4">JOSH BILLINGS ON CATS.</p>




<p>I hav studdyed cats clussly for years, and hav found them adikted tew a
wild state. Tha haint got affekshun, nor vartues ov enny kind, tha will
skratch their best friends, and wont ketch mice unless tha are hungry.
It haz bin sed that tha are good tu make up into sassages; but this
iz a grate mistake, i hav bin told bi a sassage maker that tha dont
kompare with dogs. Thare is one thing sartin, tha are verry anxious
tew liv, yu ma turn one inside out, and hang him up bi the tale, and
az soon az yu are out ov sight, he will manage tew turn back summerset
and cum around awl rite in a fu days. It iz verry hard wurk tew looze
a cat. If one gits carried oph in a bag bi mistake a grate ways into
the kuntry, tha wont sta lost onla a short time, but soon appear tew
make the family happy with their presence. Old maids are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> fond
ov cats, for the reason i suppose that cats never marry if tha hav
ever so good a chanse. Thare iz one thing about cats i dont like, if
yu step on their tales by acksident tha git mad rite oph, and make a
grate fuss about it. Thare iz anuther thing about them which makes them
a good investment for poor folks. A pair ov cats will yield each year,
without any outlay, something like eight hundred per cat. It iz a verry
singular fack that cats dont like a mill-pond, i never knu one tew git
drowned bi acksident. Tha luv cream, but it seems tew be agin their
religgun tew tutch soap. Cats and dogs have never bin able tew agree
on the main question, tha both seem tew want the affirmatiff side to
onst. I think if i could hav mi way thare wouldn't be enny more cats
born unless tha could sho a certifikate ov good moral karakter. Thare
is one more thing about cats which seems tew me tew be awl affektashun,
and that iz making sich a devlish noise under a fellers window nights,
and then kall it musik. If i waz tew hav mi choise between a cat and a
striped snake, i would take the snake bekause I could git rid ov the
snake bi letting him go. Thare aint no sartin wa tew kill a cat, if yu
git one wurked up into sassage, and yu think yu are awl right, jist
az likely az not tha will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> cum to and take off a whole lot of good
sassage with them.&mdash;Theze are mi views about cats, rather hastily hove
together, and if i haint said enuff agin them it iz onla bekause i lack
the informashun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feller Sisters</span>:&mdash;When I caste mi eye on a sirkle of luvely
wimmin bizzy with their needles, mi harte seems tew stretch clean
akross mi buzzum. And when i reflek for a minnit, that tha are tew

reddy yelping around the corner, for the very shirt tha are wurking
on, it duz seem tu me, that i cud shout hozzanner for 3 weeks on a

luves charitee, az a pup hankers for nu milk; his verry natur looks out
onto the horizen ov the poor folks, jist as the lite ov a tin lantern
shines akross a bog meddow. And he sees the little bare bak yung ones
shivering for a krust ov bread, and hungry for a shirt; then he looks
at the Sisters, a talking and sowing, and sowing and talking, and he
kounts a hole parcil ov little shirts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> on the tabil, and then he thinks
ov the widders cruise, and the bred hove onto the waters, menshioned
in the good Book, and he feels jist az tho he wud like tew own awl
the femail sowing sosieties in the wurld hisself, and put hiz hole
fortin in the little reddy made cottin shirt bizziness. Oh Charitee!
Oh Charitee! When Josh Billings communes with you, he feals az tho he

<p class="ph4">NOSHUNS.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Yankee Noshuns.</span></p>

<p>In gazeing at the different kind ov noshuns that prevale jist now,
we are struck with the vitality, and permiskuousness, ov the Yankee
noshuns. These are a kind ov noshuns that reside in Nu England, but
travel awl over the world. They are for the present known az the lead
gimblet, the basswood sperm-kandle, and the sole leather juise harp
noshun, relieved at times, by the hickory lossenge, the charkole led
pensil, and the lard bears ile noshun, and okasionally interlined, tew
keep up the appetite, with paper razor straps, plaster-paris sheep
shears, and the sour milk opedeldock noshun, which iz warranted tew
kure the attack ov a 50 cent shinplaster, in 4 seckunds; to which has
lately bin added pewter jak knives, with pork rhine handles, and itch
intement, made out ov strong butter, and lamblak. Yankee noshuns are
the affek ov tew mutch genius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hoss Noshuns.</span></p>

<p>It iz really curis how folks differ in their noshuns about hosses, sum
wants a bob-tailed hoss, and sum dont, sum wants a bay, and sum wants a
yaller, and sum wants any culler so bad that they hav tew be sent tew
state prizon, tew be healed ov their pashion for the nobel animal, the
hoss. I knu ov one old feller who waz very noshunal, he wouldn't hav a
hoss only jist so high, he never stabled him, and let him git hiz own
fodder, he kept him for 47 years, and the hoss outlived him, the last
time I saw the hoss he waz alive, but poor az wood; the old feller
called the hoss "saw-buck," and sed he waz sired bi carpenter, out ov a
white ash skantling. Hoss noshuns are well enuff, but they never ought
tew be allowed tew interfere with a man's final salvashun.</p>

</div>

<p>Perhaps thare iz no subjek that moste men agree on so well bi the
gallon, but when it comes down tew a drink, that they are so full ov
noshuns about, az their rum. I hav seen lots ov old-fashioned people,
who never thought ov drinking tanzy, unless they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> put rum into it,
and wouldn't no more drink a gin-coktale without nutmeg on the top ov
it, than they would skim milk. Then agin their iz sum who must hav
Jamaka, or the bronkeetis, one, or tuther; and sum who must hav the
belly-ake 3 or 4 times a day, or they kant relish brandee and sugar.
But thare waz one beardless boy, over whose hed skase 14 summers
had melted, who beats them awl, he aktually hove a fust class mint
julek away, and called for anuther, jist bekause it wouldn't suk fast
enuff, through the straw; I call this letting a man's good sense git
the better ov his judgment. Rum noshuns are like gitting struk with
litening, the theory iz well enuff, but the praktis is a bad one tew
git into.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Religious Creed Noshuns.</span></p>

<p>The idee that thare iz onla one way tew git tew Heaven iz awl rong,
but the idee that there iz but one Heaven tew git tew, iz awl right.
Az a gineral thing nations go tew war for the most ornary things, so
men will fite the wust kind, for a religious noshun, that they hain't
got the fust smell of. I dont care, for mi part, whether a man iz a
piscopaleyen, or a soft shell baptiss, nor I don't think the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> duz
nuther. Religious creed noshuns for man, are like the scent the foxes
leave for the hounds, the less thare iz ov it, the more kerful the dorg
hunts, and the less likely he iz tew take enny uther trak.</p>

<p class="ph4">MANIFEST DESTINY.</p>


<p>Manifest destiny iz the science ov going tew the devil, or enny other
place before yu git thare. I may be rong in this centiment, but that iz
the way it strikes me, and i am so put together that when enny thing
strikes me i immejiately strike back. Manifest destiny mite perhaps be
blocked out agin az the condishun that man and things find themselfs in
with a ring in their nozes and sumboddy hold ov the ring. I may be rong
agin, but if i am, awl i hav got tew sa iz, i don't kno it, and what
a man don't kno ain't no damage tew enny boddy else. The tru way that
manifess destiny had better be sot down iz, the exact distance that
a frog kan jump down hill with a striped snake after him; i dont kno
but i may be wrong onst more, but if the frog don't git ketcthed the
destiny iz jist what he iz a looking for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>When a man falls into the bottom ov a well and makes up hiz minde tew
stay thare, that ain't manifess destiny enny more than having yure
hair cut short iz; but if he almoste gits out and then falls down in
agin 16 foot deeper and brakes off his neck twice in the same plase
and dies and iz buried thare at low water, that iz manifess destiny
on the square. Standing behind a bull in fly time and gitting kicked
twice at one time, must feel a good deal like manifess destiny. Being
about 10 seckunds tew late tew git an express train, and then chasing
the train with yure wife, and an umbreller in yure hands, in a hot
day, and not getting az near tew the train az you waz when yu started,
looks a leetle like manifess destiny on a rale rode trak. Going into a
tempranse house and calling for a little old Bourbon on ice, and being
told in a mild way that "the Bourbon iz jist out, but they hav got
sum gin that cost 72 cents a gallon in Paris," sounds tew me like the
manifess destiny ovmoste tempranse houses.</p>

<p>Mi dear reader, don't beleave in manifess destiny untill yu see it.
Thare iz such a thing az manifess destiny, but when it occurs it iz
like the number ov rings on the rakoon's tale, ov no grate consequense
onla for ornament. Man wan't made for a machine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> if he waz, it waz a
locomotiff machine, and manifess destiny must git oph from the trak
when the bell rings, or git knocked higher than the price ov gold.
Manifess destiny iz a disseaze, but it iz eazy tew heal; i hav seen
it in its wust stages cured bi sawing a cord ov dri hickory wood. I

<p>Hard Road.&mdash;Yure essa has sum good hits intu it, but iz not jis the
thing for a religus nuzepaper, like ours; send it tu "Wilkes Spirit," a
paper that knows how tu talk hoss. I will merely suggess, that pedigree
iz not important for a fast trotting hoss; if he kan trot fast, never
minde the pedigree. Thare iz a grate menny fast men, even, who haint
got no pedigree. Thare aint mutch art in driving a trotting hoss, jist
hold them bak hard, and holler them ahead hard, thats awl. A hoss
will trot the fastest down hill, espeshila, if the briching brakes.
Kuller is no kriterion. I hav seen awful mean hosses, ov awl kullers,
excep green, i never cee a mean one ov this kuller. Hosses liv tew
an honarabil old age, and i hav often seen them, that apeared fully
prepared for deth. Heathins are alwus kind tew hosses; it iz only among

<p>Dogs are various in kind, and thanks tew an allwise Providence, tha are
various in number. Tha are the onla animil ov the brute perswashun,
who hav voluntary left a wilde stait ov natur, and cum in under the
flag ov man. Tha are not vagabones bi choise, and luv tew belong tu
sumbody. This fac endears them tew us, and i hav alwas rated the dog
az about the seventh cusin tew the humain specious. Tha kant talk, but
tha kan lick yure hand, this shows that their hearts iz in the plase
where uther folks' tungs iz. Dogs in the lump are useful, but tha are
not alwas proffittable in the lump. The Nufoundlin dog is useful tew
saive childiren from drowning, but yu hav got tew hav a pond or water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and children running around kareless, or else the dog aint profitable.
Thare aint nothing maid boarding a Nufoundlin dog. Rat Tarries air
useful tew kech rats, but the rats aint proffittable after yu hav
keched them. The Shepard dog is useful tew drive sheep, but if yu hav
got tew go and buy a flock ov sheep, and pay more than tha are wurth,
jist to keep the dog bizzy, the dog aint proffittable, not mutch. Lap
dogs are very useful, but if yu dont hold them in yure lap awl the
time, tha aint proffittable at all. Bull dogs are extremely useful, but
yu hav got tew keep a bull too, or else yu kant make ennything on the
dog. The Coach dog iz one ov the moste usefullest ov dogs i kno ov,
but yu hav got to hav a coach, (and that aint alwus pleasant) or yu
kant realize from the dog. Thus we cee, that while dogs are ginerally
useful, thare are times, when tha aint ginerally proffittable. I dont
really luv a Yaller dog, nor a mad dog, but with these two unfortunate
excepshuns, it is dredful hard work for me to sa a hard word agin a
dog; the wag ov their tails is what takes me. Enny man who will abuze
a dog, neadn't ask me to luv him, or pra for him. Enny man who will
abuze a dog will abuse a woman, and enny man who will abuse a woman is
thirty-five or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> forty miles meaner than&mdash;a pale paller dog. These are
my centiments, and i shant change them, until i receive notice that the
camel has smoothed down the hump on his back, and the sarpent ceases
tew wiggle when he wanders.</p>

<p>Life is short, but it iz long enuff to ruin enny man who wants tew be

<p>When the soul iz in grief, it iz taking root, and when it iz in

<p>The grate art in writing well, iz tew kno when tew stop.</p>

<p>Every time yu forgive a man yu weaken him, and strengthen yurself.</p>

<p>Mi private opinion iz, that i should prefer boned fish tew boned

<p>"Giv the devil his due," but be very kerful that thare aint mutch due

<p class="ph4">FASHION.</p>


<p>Fashion is a compound mixtur ov much taist, and sum vanitee. The taist
that is into it, saives it from ridikule. Fashun iz just az necessara
tu govern men and wimmin with, az sivil law; in fack menny folks wud
ruther brake a statu than tu ware a cut tale tu short, or a bunnet tu
obtuze.</p>

<p>Exsentrisity iz one thing, and fashun iz anuther thing. We haint got
no more rite tu laff at fashun, than we hav tu laff at vittels. What
a man, or woman eats, if it iz well cooked, iz all rite, and what tha
ware, if it iz well cooked, is ditto.&mdash;After fashuns hav had their da,
then iz the time tu despize them; just so it iz with vittels; cold
vittels for instanze.</p>

<p>Nobody iz tu blame for old fashuns. If our grate grand mother shud
meet our present mother, both ov them dressed in the fashun ov their
respek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>tif daze, tha wud go tu kalling each other old Fools, and we
should stan by, and offer tu bet on it. If evry boddy had a fashun ov
their own, it wud make az mutch trubble az a shinplaster kurrensy. Them
that sett the fashun, aught tu be vartuous and big minded, bekauze the
morals ov a people are just about az mutch inflooensed by fashun az tha
are by religun. In them daze, when tha had no partiklar fashun, tha
didn't hav partiklar enny thing else. It iz more evidense ov vanitee to
rejek fashun, than it iz tu adopt it.</p>

<p>Evra boddy, more or lessly, hankers after fashun. Fashun makes the
poor ambishus, and it makes the rich affabil; it makes the vartuous
cheerful, and it makes the humbly kind ov handsum, and thare iz no
reson why it shud make the modest bold, enny more than elegense shud
make the butiful wicked. Thare has alwus bin wolfs in sheeps clothing,
and fashun will okasionally be used for the same purpis, but that aint
enny reson why mutton aint good, nor why fashun shud be hipokrasy.
Bekauze sum peopil are slaves tu fashun only proves its power, and yu
will find that thoze who are its slaves are ginerally free from moste
ov the big sins that humin natur iz subjec tu. The big minded, and the
noble, adopt fash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>un jist az tha du enny uther proper kustom, simpla
bekause it iz the fashun.</p>

<p>It is tru that sum ov the fashuns are absurd, and it is tru that sum ov
the vartues are absurd also. If a fashun kant be maid tu square itself
tu the rules ov either good cense or good taist, it aint fashun, it is
consait. A grate menny folks ced that whoops was a failure, but tha
held their own, and grew nisely; tha are realy evra thing in a hot da.
I shud like tu set in one all thru Juli and August; a feller wud be as
cool as a dog's nose in a wire muzzel.</p>

<p>Az the white rose wakens intu buty, so dus the white Pig cum tu gladden
us. His ears are like the lilac leaf, played upon bi the young zephurs
at eventide, his silkaness is the woof ov buty, and his figger is the
outline ov lovlaness. His food is white nectar, drawn from the full
fountain ov affecshun. He waxes fatter, and more slik, evra da, and
hangs from the buzzum ov his muther like an image ov alabastur. He
laffeth at forms, and curleth his tale still clusser, as his feast
goeth on, then he riseth with gladness, and wandereth with his kindred,
beside the still waters. His brothers and sisters are az like him as
flakes ov snow, and all the day long, amung the red klover, and beneath
the white thorn, he maketh his joy, and leadeth a life arkadian. His
words are low musik, and his language the untutored freshness ov natur.
His pastime is the his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>tory ov innersence, and his lessure is elaganse.
He walketh whare grase leadeth, and gambles tew the dallianse ov dewy
fragranse. He gathereth straws in his mouth, and hasteneth awa on
errants ov gladness. He listeneth tu the reproof of hiz parent; his
ackshuns are the laws ov perliteness, and his logick is the power ov
instinkt. His datime is pease and his evening is gentle forgitfullness.
As he taketh on years, he loveth kool plases, and delveth in liquids,
and stirreth the arth tew a fatness, and painteth hisself in dark
cullers, a reffuge from flize, and the torments ov life. He forgetteth
his parent, and bekumeth his own master, and larneth the mistery ov
food, and groweth hugely. Men gaze at his porkyness, and kount his
vallu bi pounds, and la in wate for him, and sacrifise him, and give
his flesh salt for its safety. This is Pig life.</p>

<p class="ph4">A LEKTURE TO MALE YOUNG MEN ONLY.</p>


<p>Yu are about 2 begin life, yung men, for the fust time, and I suppose
thare wud be no impropriety in mi saing, for the last time tew. It is
hily important or thereabouts, that yu set down in sum kool plase,
and take an honest akount ov stok, or in other wurds, less poetick
but equally tru, yu sarch out the ramifikashun ov natur, and see what
natur haz ramified yu for. Now skriptur will tell yu, that men don't
gether pigs from thissels, neither dus the husband, nor hiz wife, nor
enny ov his relashuns, plant korn when tha are after pumpkins, nor
sow bukwheat, when he iz a lookin for old rye. Kauze and affeck iz
anuther awful good thing to studdy; yu will find this talked ov in Dan
Webster's dicktionary. Having follered the above advise, and having
hefted the above reasoning, yu will cum tew the konklusion, whether
it iz best for yu tu studdy law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> or studdy shumaking, both ov them
honerabil biznisses, and equally kondusiv tew helth. Yu will also be
enabled tew bet with dispatch, whether yu hav a kall, tew preach the
gospil, or sel yankee no shuns at auction, both ov them respektuous if
honestla follared, and both ov them liabel tew be led estra, and end
at laste in the bronkeetis. The studdy ov medisin will present itself
and flap its wings and crow, but it kant fule yu, bekause yu have sot
down, as rekomended above, and tuk akount ov yure liabilitys, and kno
tew a spot whether yu air konstructed rite for a veteran surgeon amung
hosses, or hav the rite natur for dealing out kalamil &amp; gallup amung
men, wimmin &amp; childrin. Yu will likewize hav it in yure power tew gess
clussly between being a kolporter or keeping a billiard tabil; if yu
find that yure goose iz morally sound, yu will itinerate at onst, but
if yu diskiver a leak in yure base, yu will take up yure cue, naturally
&amp; akordinly. Selling dri goods and blaksmithing wil klaim yure especial
notis, and wil bother yu dredfully for a verdik; but if yu find yu hav
kalico on the brain, &amp; aint afraid tew stretch the cloth &amp; the truth
a little, when yu mezure it, yu will straddle the kounter like an
ingyrubber clothes pin, and smile on yure kus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>tomers like a sleeping
babe trubbled with wind. Yu wil, without doubt, be asked tu sa whether
yu wil be a pollytisian or a blakleg, both equally honorabil. If yu
hav enny reasonable douts about cheatin yure moste intimate frends,
and aint willing tew be seen in low grogerys on lecktion daze, buying
votes with cheap whiska and kounterfit munny, and dont expek tew buy
yure elekshun, and then sell yure prinsiples tew git even; if yu kant
go this, and tend awl the churches near yu in rotashun, and hear folks
sa, "What an ornyment to sosiety he iz!" i sa, if yu kant go all this
without blushing, yu will ov course adopt the blakleg, and gain an
honest living bi cheatin on the square.</p>

<p>Yung men yu will awl detek in this lekture a frendla feeling towards
yu bi the author, and if yu foller the direckshuns laid down above, yu
wil diskiver the wigglings ov yure genius, in time perhaps, tew saive
yureselfs from cuming the govenor ov sum state, when natur kindly
ramified yu for a carpenter and jiner.</p>

<p>It is perfectly astounding how full ov <i>clever fellows</i> the world
iz. Yu kan find them almost ennywhere, on the korner ov the streets,
reddy tew say, "mi dear fellow how are yu?" and adjourn at onst tew
the hotell and take a drink with yu. Yu can find them in the churches,
reddy tew slap yu on the back and take yure meazure for a front pew,
next tew the Hon. Hannibal Herring Hallibut, Esq., at the lucid figger
ov $450 Dollars per year, and a liberal chanse at the contribushun
plate, twice evry Sunda. Yu kan find them in the lucky possession ov a
blood bay pair ov geldings sired by Casshus M. Klay, and jist refused
tu the widder ov a defunk sope biler, at $2700 dollars, but tew yu!
confidensially! tew yu!! tha will be placed at $2000. Yu kan find them

Good Lord! Good Lord! how thick tha are. I alwus treat theze fellers

<p class="center">TO CONTRIBUTORS.</p>

<p>"<i>I Hear an Angell Whispre</i>," by <i>Clemantha</i>.&mdash;Theze lines contain more
poeckry, and less truth. The fact is, Angells don't whispre, if tha hav

<p class="ph4">A SHORT AND VERY AFFEKTING ESSA ON MAN.</p>


<p>Man iz a problem not yet solved, made out ov dirt, and smells ov the
material. He waz kreated a little lower than the angells, and haz bin
gittin a little lower ever sinse. He waz given a butiful hum, clus tew
the borders ov heaven, the fruit and the flower waz planted for him,
and the sweet waters were led along hiz futpath, birds sung onla for
him, and woman was bilt tew make hiz joy komplete. The lam laid her hed
on the lion's buzzum, and the viper knu not ov his sting. The winds
waz tempered with soft fragranse, and awl things had onla the soul ov
innersence in them. Guile there waz none, fear there waz none, even
hope thare waz none, for thare waz nothing tew want. This waz butiful
tew behold, but it didn't prove enny thing, but the kindness ov God.
Could the arth be peopled? could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> the oseans be crossed? could the
forest be chopped down? could sittys be built? could enny boddy be made
tew work when thare waz nothing to hope for and nothing tew want? Man
waz created tew govern a world ov ruggidness, and he couldn't dew it
bi being as harmless as a dove; he must hav a touch ov a good sized
sarpent in him, or he would has lived, he and hiz wife, growing butiful
and useless, forever, in the Garden ov Eden. Man never waz bilt for the
Garden ov Eden; he waz onla put thare tew see its buty, but not tew
enjoy it till he had arnt it; not tew liv thare untill a weary round
had bin paced. Eden waz hiz kradle, Eden was the pla ground ov hiz yung
Adamhood, and under hiz vine and fig treeze waz hiz old age tew be
gathered. How menny ov the countless millions, who hav gone forth from
the pearly gate ov the garden hav ever entered agin? Sum few, perhaps
hav got back, weary and worn, sum few hav got back within sight ov its
glory, and sleep thare, but legions lay whare they hav fell az far from
their hum az wandering feet could carry them; and man after 5,000 years
ov birthrite tew awl the glora ov heaven, and arth, iz az mutch ov a
problem az ever. If he governs the arth&mdash;if the lightnings obey him&mdash;if
art iz the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> monark ov natur, and if even the angels are at times
tempted tew admire him, strugling with the sarpent, iz he not, at this
day, a moste magnificent failure? kan he, who haz governed so mutch,
that even angels would shudder tew attack, can he govern <i>himself</i>.
This iz the problem. It iz but a step from the furtherest grave tew the
garden ov Eden, but how few will take it. We awl know the wa back tew
the kradle ov Eden. We awl long tew be thare asleep, but if God dont
take us in hiz arms, az froward children are taken, how few thare will
be, who will ever git hum. Man iz the problem, God iz the solution.</p>

<p class="ph4">THE RASE KOARSE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Grate rase! at Sulphur Flat trotting Park, on Thursda, April 9th,
for a puss ov 13 dollars, and a bulls-eye watch, free for awl hosses,
mares, geldings, mules, and Jackasses!"</p></blockquote>


<p>Seeing the above anounsement, pasted up on a gide board, at "Jamaka rum
four corners," and having never saw a hoss trot, on a well regulated
rase koarse, for the improvement ov the breed ov hosses, i agreed i wud
go, jist tew encourage the breeding ov good hosses. I found the village
of Sulphur Flats located in a lot and well watered bi a griss-mill
and 2 tannerys. The prinsipal buildings seem tu consiss ov a tavern
stand, 3 groserys, an insurance offiss, and anuther tavern stand, awl
condukted on strik whiskee prinsiples. I found the inhabitants a good
deal tired in their religus views and i thought the opening wud admit 3
or 4 missionarys abreast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>The moste prinsipal bizness ov the peopil waz pealing bark in the
winter, and pitchin cents az soon az warm wether sot in. I asked a
gentleman present, who ced he waz a reporter for "The Yung Man's
Christian Gide," if he knew what the poplashun ov the plase definitely
waz, and he ced he definitely didn't, but if i would set out a pail ov
whiskee, with a dipper into it, on the top ov a hemlock stump, that
grew in front ov the tavern, it wouldn't be 60 minnits befour i cud
count the whole ov them, and then we both ov us smiled, az it were, tew
onst. Having asked sum uther inquirys, ov a mexed natur, i santered
down tu where the rase koarse waz.</p>


<p class="center">THE TRACK.</p>

<p>I found the track waz about a mild in circumferense, and ov a sandy
disposishun, fensed in by a kranbury mash on one side, and a brush
fense on tuther, and in jist about 3 minnet condishun. The judge's
stand waz an ox cart surrounded on the sides bi a ha rigging, and the
reporters waz invited tew git intu the cart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">THE HOSSES</p>

<p>Waz a gra mare, about the usual stature, not verry fat, and laboring
under a spring halt, which tha ced she had caught ov anuther hoss,
about 10 days ago. Tha ced she had trotted tu a kamp-meeting last fall
inside ov a verry short time, and that her back bone waz awl game. I
asked a yung man with long yeller hair and bedtick pantyloons on, who
waz currying oph the mare, what her pedigree was, and he with a wink
tew anuther feller who stood clus bi, ced, "she waz got bi the Landlord
out ov a Methdiss minister," and then tha both laffed. I found out bi
inquirin, that her name waz "Fryin-Pan." The uther hoss waz a red hoss,
rather hastily konstructed, with a spare tale on him, which tha ced waz
kaused by his trotting so fast, in a windy day; i shud think he waz
about 5 feet and a haf in hite, and ov a kickin natur. Tha ced he waz a
stranger in theze parts, and that his rite name waz "Juise Harp."</p>


<p class="center">FUST HEAT.</p>

<p>The hosses both cum up tew the skore in the immejiate visinity ov
each uther, and got the wurd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> tew go, the fust time. The gra mare waz
druv bi "Dave Larkin," and the hoss was handled bi "Ligh Turner." Tha
trotted sublimely, az clus az the Siamese twins; the mare with her hed
hi up and her noze full ov winde; the hoss waz stretched out tite,
like a chalk line; tha passed the haf mile pole simultaneously, time,
2 minnits. Now the kontost becum exsiting, "Dave" hollered, and "Ligh"
yelled&mdash;on tha kum, the mare gru higher, and the hoss gru longer&mdash;tha
make the last turn tew onst&mdash;tha look like a dubble team&mdash;the
exsitement grows more intensely&mdash;the crowd sways to and fro&mdash;the ox
cart trembles&mdash;tha cum! tha cum! sich shouting, sich yelling, sich
swearing, sich chawing terbacker, waz never herd before; the mare iz
ahed!&mdash;no, the hoss iz ahed! 'tis even, 'tis a ded hete, tha pass the
ox-kart&mdash;the hoss wins bi 3 quarters ov an inch, time 4 minnits lacking
2 seckunds.</p>


<p class="center">REMARKS.</p>

<p>The bosses ar surrounded bi a crowd ov men, wimmin, and children. Each
party are sanguinary ov suckces. The bettin iz 2 quarts ov whiskee to
anything, on the red hoss. At this junktare the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> gentleman, reporter
for the Young Man's Christian Gide, propozed tew bet 75 cents that the
mare wud win the nex heat; i tuk the proposishun forthwithly, and the
steaks, bi mutual consent, was placed in mi hat and sot under the kart,
and here let me stait, before i forget it, that i haint saw the steaks
nor the hat sinse.</p>


<p class="center">SECKUND HEAT.</p>

<p>The hosses both sho signs ov distress. The gra mare's ears hang down
the side ov her hed, like two wet rags, and the hoss rests his tale on
the ground. Tha go slola bak tew the distanse pole, and cum up agin tew
the skore, az tho tha waz yoked together. Awa tha go; the hoss a leetle
ahed. The hoss leads tew the haf mild pole in 2:30. On the bak stretch,
"Dave" went at the mare with hiz long purswader; she trots like
litening, she passes the hoss! no! she busts! she busts! and befour
"Dave" cud flatten her down tew her work, she broke from the trak and
trotted clean up tew her hips in the krambery mash. The hoss cum in awl
alone, trotting fast, and so clus down, that 2 feet ov his tale dragged
on the ground. Time ov this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> heat, not fur from 5 minnits. "Juise Harp"
winning, bi a quarter ov a mild. Thus ended the grate rase at "Sulphur
Flats." I immejiately started on foot for "Jamaka Rum four corners,"
bare headed, but fully impressed that, tho men, and even whiskee mite
deteryoate, the breed ov hosses must begin tew improve in that seckshun
ov the kuntry in a fu dais.</p>

<p>This iz good advise. I don't kno who waz the auther ov it, if I did,
i wud go for rewarding him, either with a sett ov plated ware, or a
prize in the art union. No man kould giv better advise, or consolashun;
he ought tew hav a 2 story monament, when he dize, with an epitaff on
it, founded on fack; he ought tew hav at leaste fifteen hundred little
children named after him each year; he ought tew be nussed in men's
memorys like a plesant dreme, that afterwards turned out tew be true.
He ought to hav his fotograph taken bi evry new sky-lite in the land,
he ought tew be sett tew musick, and be sung in conneckshun with the
docksaloger; he ought tew be stereotyped, so that nu edishuns could
constantly be worked oph tew meet the pressing demand.</p>

<p>"Giv the Devil hiz due." Yung man, this ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>vise was got up for yu. If

and dont hire him over agin at enny prise. That's what the author ment.
Be honest, pay even the devil, if yu owe him, but dont owe him agin. If
the proprietor ov this most worthy proverb, "Giv the devil hiz due,"
still lives, altho i haint had the pleasure ov an introducksion tew

<p><i>Amerikus.</i>&mdash;Your contribushun is in hand. We like its fluidness. It
is like ile on a side hill. Natur haz did a good thing for yu, and
yu ought tew be willing tew dew a good thing for natur. This line in
your produkshun strikes us as very butiful and original; "And larn the
luxury of dewing good." Gold smith hisself mite hav bin proud ov sich
a line. And again; "Oh would sum power the gifty giv us, ov seeing
oursels as uthers cee us;" yure idee ov indroducing the skotch acksent
into yure stile, is verry happee. If yu never hav red Robert Burns, yu
will be suprised to larn that his style verry mutch resembles yures.
Onse more yu sa; "If ignoranse is bliss, tis folly tew be wise." This

<p>It is highly important, when a man makes up his minde tew bekum a

<p>As a gineral thing, when a woman wares the britches, she has a good

<p>No man luvs tu git beat, but it is better tew git beat than tew be

<span class="i2">"Musick hath charms to sooth a savage.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To rend a rok or split a kabbage."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>


<p>So tha tell me, but i shud rather try a revolver on the savage, a blast
ov powder on the rok, and good sharp vinegar on the kabbage. I haint
searched history tew diskiver who giv the first consert ov musik. We
are told, that in <i>those days</i> "the stars sang together," but in <i>theze
days</i> yu kant git stars tew sing together. We often hear it said,
"that such a person haz a good ear for musik." I don't fellership this
remark; awl a person wants tew understand musik with, is a good soul;
a "good ear" haint got enny more tew du with it than a good sett ov
brains has tu do with charity. Musical crickets insist that if the
gammut aint rite, the musik aint rite; this is awl nonsense; the gammut
haint got enny more tew du with a musick-hungry man, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> a knife and
fork has with his dinner, if he is real hungry he can eat with his
fingers. Musick want got up tew make us wise, but better natured. How
much opera musick dew you suppose it wud taik tu make a man cry? Folks
will tell yu that such an "overture fria dabulo" (or sum uther furrin
big named thing) "waz moste heavenly rendered," tha mite as well tell
me that a pumpkin pie was heavenly rendered. What do i care about the
rendering, if i don't git a piece ov the pie? Let some Prime Donner,
or Mezzer Soapraner, or Barrytown Base, or some sich latin individual,
cum into this village, and histe their flag, and hav a programmy ov
singing as long as a sarch warrant, and as hard tu spell out as a
chinese proklamashun ritten upside down, and taxed seventy-five cents
for a preserved seat, and moste evrybody will go tu hear it, bekause
moste everybody else dus, and will sa, evry now and then, (out loud)
"how bewitching! how delishus! how egstatick!" and nineteen out ov
evry twenty-one ov them wouldn't kno it if the performance was a
burlesk on their grandmother. Wouldn't it be fun tew cee one ov these
opera singers undertake tu rok a baby tu sleep? i gess thare wud be
two parts carried tu that song about that time. Suppoze yu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> shud come
home at nite, a weary boy, and la yure hed in mother's lap, and she
shud let out a opera, good Lord! wouldn't yu think yure mother was a
lunatik, or ought to be one at onst, tu save her karacter. "Korrect
taist," iz anuther big wurd; ive herd folks uze it whose finger nales
wanted cleaning. Musik, after all, is sumthing like vittels, the more
cooking and seasoning we uze, the more we have to hav, till after
awhile we kant enjoy ennything ov the vittels but the pepper.&mdash;Opera
dont hav enny more loosening affeck on me, than caster ile wud on a
graven image. I set and gaze, and hark, and cee the whole aujence in
hirogliphicks, and awl i kan do iz tu git mad that sich stuff is called
musik. But awl the reasoning in the wurld wont convince menny people
that tha haint got a rite tew go into fits over an opera tha dont
understand a word ov; it iz the fashion tew expire and hav their souls
dissolve in latin at the rate ov seventy-five cents, an it haz got to
be did, "sink or swim, survive or perish." If enny boddy wants tu go
and hear a man or woman disgorge musik, that has more kolik than melody
into it, i suppose (under the constitushun) tha hav jist the same rite
tew crusifi themselves enny uther wa, for sumbody's else sins that tha
dont kno the natur of."</p>

<p class="ph4">"MAN WAZ MADE TEW MOURN."</p>


<p>This waz the private opinion ov one Burns, a Skotchman, who waz very
edikated tew poetri from his infansy. I and he differ, which is not
uncommon among grate minds. The ornary minds in this wurld are disposed
tew coinside, which iz the reson whi superstitions prevale so mutch.
Tew differ upon matters with anuther is a fair presumpshun that yu are
in the habit ov smelling ov things before yu swaller them. Man warnt
made tew mourn, man waz made tew laff. He iz the onla creeter or thing
that God made tew laff out loud. It iz tru he knows how to mourn, so
duz the animills kno how, the birds can tell their sorrows, and the
flowers kan hang their pretty heds. Man waz made tew smile, tew laff,
tew haw! tew thro up his hat, and sing halleluger. Man waz made tew
praze God, and he cant dew it bi mourning. Awl the mourning thare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
iz in this wurld was introduced bi man; man warnt made tew mourn any
more than he was made to crawl. Tharfore i sa tew awl men and women,
stop crying and go tew laffing, yu will last longer, and git fatter
and stand jist as good a chanse tew git tew heaven with a smile on
your countenanse, as yu will with yure fase leaking at every pore. I
sa man want made tew mourn, if he had bin he would not hav bin put in
Paradise, whare every thing else was made in the image ov smiles.</p>


<p>P.S.&mdash;I don't want ennybody tew think that i am down on Burns, for i
dew consider him the most Poet that ever lived. I had ruther be the
authur ov one poum i kno ov, that he rit, than tew be king and queen ov
England, and keep a hoss and carriage; but "man warnt made tew mourn"
Robert Burns, he iz the kause of hiz own sorrow. For enny further

<p class="ph4">KISSING CONSIDERED.</p>


<p>"Man was made tew mourn," so warbled Burns, "and woman was made tew
kiss," so warbles Billings. One ov these centiments haz bin alreddy
immortalised, and the other i intend shall be as soon as the Legislater
meets. I am not yet lusid how i shall bring the matter befoar that
honorabil boddy; but i dew kno how the honorabel boddy feals on the
subject, and how tha will act if ever tha hav a good chanse. To give a
fertile and golden opinyun, upon kissing in the lump, and kissing in
the detale, requires a man ov truth, and sum experiense in tasteing.</p>


<p class="center">IN THE LUMP.</p>

<p>Kissing iz one ov those fu things that is easier dun than deskribed;
in fack, about the onla way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> tew deskribe it well is tew do it well.
It iz, without doubt, a verry anshunt enterprise; and judgeing from
what we kno ov human natur in this latitude, it must hav struk Adam
as a good investment when he fust diskovered hiz wife. If Adam didn't
kiss Eve at sight he aint the man i take him tew be; and if Eve didn't
relish it, it must hav bin bekause it want well did. Thare iz one thing
about kissing in the lump, diffrent from the rest ov the fine arts and
that iz, it don't require enny eddikashun tew dew it; i hav even thort
that the more unedikated it waz did (provided it didn't miss the mark)
the more touching it was tew behold. But kissing is a good deal like
eating; thare is not much fun (when a person iz hungry) in standing by,
and see it did bi anuther fellow, if it iz did ever so well. It is one
ov the cheapess and healthyess luxurys ov the season, and don't sho
enny disposishun tew go out ov fashion, and will keep sweet in enny
climate. Upon the whole, if yu examine kissing in the lump, clussly,
yu will be led tew exclaim: Fustly, that it iz as easy tew hav it did,
az it is handy tew dew it. Sekundly, that it is like Cowpers tea, it
cures a man without corning him; and, Thirdly, it is a frugal, highly
consentrated, and reverend luxury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">IN DETALE.</p>

<p>When we cum tew thro oph glittering generalitys and approach our
subjeck in single file, it is then that the divinitee ov the art
seems to be spotted; and reveals tew us awl the shades ov pomp and
sirkumstanze, from the sublime and tender, clear down tew the redikilus
and tuff. Mother's kiss and little baby's kiss are az pure az the
utterance ov angells; so is the artless kiss ov sister Mary and&mdash;couzin
Fanny; but thare iz one cold, blu, lean kiss, that alwus makes me
shiver tew see. Two persons (ov the femail perswashun) who hav witnesst
a grate menny younger and more pulpy daze, meet in sum publik plase,
and not having saw each uther for 24 hours tha kiss immegiately; then
tha talk about the weather, and the young man who preached yesterday,
and then tha kiss immegiately, and then tha blush and laff at what
tha sa tew each other, and kiss agin immegiately. I would not objeckt
tew awl this if it want sich a waste ov swetness on the dessart air.
I am willing tew be sworn that this kind ov kissing alwus puts me
in minde ov two olde flints trieing tew strike fire. How different
this from the konnubial kiss i witnesst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> laste nite. I knu he wast a
husband jist got back from a bizzness tower, bi hiz haste. He passt
me at the korner below, and awl unexpected enkountered hiz wife, and
as natral as the bee tew the flower, tha flu together. Thare want
enny thing sentimental about that kiss; thare want enny thing criminal
about it. It rang out on the air as clear as the challenge ov a perlice
offiser&mdash;it filled a whole block. Thare want mutch prelimnary about it
neither, for it smashed a 50 dollar bonnett, and muxed up a barricade
ov edging and frizzled tucker. It want the fust one, it waz tew well
did for that. It want the sipping ov two trembling lovers, afraid ov
the echo; it want studdyed out nor stolen, but it wast full ov honest
ripeness and chastened struggle which made me hanker for&mdash;for, one oph
from the same peace. Jist one more remark and I am thru. Thare is one
kind ov kissing that has alwus been deeemd extra hazardous (on akount
ov fire) and that is kissing yure naber's wife. Gitting the wife's
consent don't seem tew make the matter enny the less risky.</p>

<p>Bi invitashun i had the happiness tew attend a speerit cirkle in the

name of Professer McGuire, with a face that looked like a sucked lemon,
waz the midwife ov the okasion. It seemed that a Mister Bloodgood
wanted a dispatch from Miss Jerusha Perkins, who, he claimed, was in

ensued, sum ov the alfiredest thumps took plase on the tabel; mi hair
begin tew stan up, and i wished i waz out ov the consarn; but after
taking an akount ov stock i cum tew the inference that i could knock
the spots oph from the whole bileing ov them, if it cum to actooal
bizzness i agreed tew set still and see the whole sport.</p>

<p>In a fu space ov time McGuire begin tew git news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> from Jerusha, which
he ced waz official and waz in the shape ov a letter, and he wud
translate it as follers:</p>



<p class="author">
<i>May 20th</i>, <span class="smcap">Speerit Land</span>, 1846.

<p>"<i>Dear Augustus Sidney Bloodgood</i>: Having a fu spare time tew devote

well, and hope theze fu lines will find yu enjoying the same blessin.
I hav jist returned from the gardin ov Eden whare i hav bin with Dave
Sturgiss, who was killed at the battell ov Gettisburg bi gitting
choked with a pease ov hard tacks. The weather iz fine, and there iz
evry prospeck ov krops; I never see the potaters look finer. Dri goods
is cheap here, yu can buy good factory cottin cloth, yard wide, for
eleven cents a yard and hav thred thrown in. I see the Widder Bostwick
yesterday, she looks as starched up as ever.</p>

<p>"Would yu beleaf it, dear Augustus, that ugly Miss Snubdin is here,
how yu used tew hate her! yu kno yu used tew sa that she wud go tew
that uther land ov speerits. Let me hear from yu oftin thru the dear
McGuire. Me and anuther speerit bi the name of Julia roost on the same
celestial tree, and we oftin talk over the fellers we used tu know,
and yu kan bet high, dear Augustus, that yu are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> one that i brag
on. Don't let enny ov them terestial mortals fool yu with their luv,
for Jerusha's essence has no affinitee but for her corporeal jewell,
Augustus Sidney Bloodgood."</p>

<p>At this junkter thare waz 6 raps on the tabel about az fast and loud
az tho there waz playing kards, and sumboddy about being eukered; then
awl was still and the kandels waz lit, and evry boddy sot in aw and
amazement. The sircle broke up immejiately, and i passed out with mi
frend, who asked me what i thought ov speerit manifestashuns now. I

<p>"Hum agin! Hum agin! from a forrin shore!" or in uther wurds less

went tew git mi buty and health restored. I waz thare 2 weeks, and
lost 50 pounds in munny, and gained 10 pounds in meat. i feal like a

The natur ov the sile or land there iz impregnated with sand, which
iz adapted tew raisin a dust when the wind bloze, and also iz capabel
ov produsing, (az i see bi the statisticks ov the state sensus) more
fleas tew the aker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> without the aid ov manure, than iz needed for hum

water, which are to be had in enny quantity, at a slite advanse from
fust cost. The men and wimmin go in swimming together which at the
fust sight looks a leetle risky, but az soon az they git used tew it,
tha tell me, tha aint afrade ov each other at all. Thare iz 15 taverns
at Long Branch, and thare iz ground room tew build more ov them, and
az far az i kno, no man need tew go away without spending awl ov hiz
munny, if he haz got enny ambishun about him. Thare waz sevral verry
fashionable wimmin on exhibishun thare, and altho they didn't hav on
mutch clothes, what they did hav, waz wuth the munny. I also saw sevral
diamonds thare, which they ced were discovered at little falls, in

pleazing feeter waz the fast trotting hosses which belonged tew the
natives ov the surrounding country, which were brought down in front ov
the taverns evry day, tew trot for the amuzement, &amp; instruktion, ov the
guests. The Hosses didn't seem to me tew trot az fast az the drivers
did, but i dont think enny body ever saw more dust raized, still, if
hollering out loud iz enny sign that the hosses waz a trot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>ting fast,
then Flory Temple never had any bizness at Long Branch, unless it waz
for her health. Hoss trotting iz at best a cruel enterprize, but when
it iz gone into, with slow hosses, and unskillful drivers, it iz about
az disgusting az the opening ov Rockaway clams, with a shoe-hammer.
You will find awl the different styles ov docktrine and pollyticks, at
Long Branche. One feller asked me "if i didn't think that the southern
confederasy would be recognized before long," and i ced, that the
southren confederasy had bin <i>recognized</i>, for more than 3 years, bi
awl sensibel &amp; honest people, az the moste cussidest ov awl things
cussid. And another feller asked me what i thought ov the doktrine ov
poligamy. i replied tew him, in a few wurds, that it waz tew mutch
doktrine, for enny one man tew hav, and dew the subjeck justiss. Az
good a way az enny tew git tew Long Branch, iz bi the steam Bote Jesser
Hoyt, and the Delaware Ba ralerode. The cars on this rale rode will put
enny man in minde ov one ov the cages in which van amburgh's trained
animels are carried around the kuntry, and az for speed, thare iz but
one thing on arth slower, and that iz a bread pill. In konclusion,
Long Branch iz about the onla thing in the state ov Nu Jersee, that
dont belong tew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> the Camptown, and Amboy Ralerode, and ought tew be
visited as a natral curiosity on that vera akount, if for no uther. The
prinsipel amuzements ov the plase are pitching cents, and walking a
mile and a half, back into the kuntry, tew see a liberty pole. Thare iz
one custom thare that mite be altered, if it couldn't be improved, and
that iz awl the niggers seem tew hav bin born for the express purpiss
ov standing around when a guest leaves, with evry feature in their fase
resembling a 25 cent shinplaster in distress, and even the Landlord's
look, and act az tho you waz going oph, without paying them awl the
munny yu had. Visiting Long Branch, in this respeck, iz like going down
into a marsh, in muskeeter time, awl the inhabitants stick a bill into
you. Thare iz no ingenuity in this wa ov skinning a man, it iz like
skinning a cat, a little evry day, tew make it hurt less.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i>&mdash;Now yu ask me tew mutch. I kant giv no sartin resippee tew
make a feller pop the question. Sum men are awful slow on a court, tha
are like olde houn dogs, all tha want iz to be sure tha are on the rite
track, and don't seem tew kare if tha don't never cum up with the game.
If i was a gal, and one ov this kind ov dogs got after me, i wud hole
rite off, and if he didn't commense tu dig me out at onst, i shud kno
he waz only hunting for fun.</p>



<p><i>Rebekar.</i>&mdash;I am dredful sorry tew hear yu are a widder. I kno how tu
pity yu, i haint never bin a widder miself, but i hav bin in a habit
ov pittying widders, for a grate length ov time. And yu tell me yu are
a yung widder too, wuss and wusser. If yu find that thare aint nobody
in yure naberhood who understands pittying yung widders, let me kno at
onst, and i will see what kan be did for yu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Flora.</i>&mdash;I like yure spirit, yu hav got a soul. Thare aint no diskount
on to it. Stan yure ground, don't giv an inch the olde man will cum
to hiz milk bimeby. The idee that yu kant hav a bonnet az good as Sal
Parker haz got, iz darned likely. If i waz a gal, and mi olde man
wouldn't go 50 dollars for me a plane bonnet, blame me if i wouldn't go
into a dekline, spit blood, or hav a pane in the bak, or see a ghost,
and set and shiver till the olde man cum doun with the bonnet.</p>



<p><i>Lizzy.</i>&mdash;Yu sa yu are sixteen years old, and aint marrid yet. That
looks a little dusty, but don't dispare, az long az thare iz life
theres hope. If i hear ov enny boddy looking around for a woman, ill
let yu kno forthwithly. Send me forty or fifty ov yure fotograffs, tha
are good things tu skatter around luce. Az i ced in mi last letter i
kant la doun no rule tu kech a hustband, men kant tell themselves half
the time what ketched them, awl tha kno iz that tha git keched the
cussedest evra now and then.</p>



<p><i>Matilda.</i>&mdash;Lap dogs are verry skase jist now prinsipally owing tew
the skasity ov them. I see one yesterda that was almost heavenly. The
owner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> asked 50 dollars for him, he had sore eys, and the itch, but tha
tell me that awl lap dogs haz theze trifling komplantes. I saw anuther
one, which the owner onla asked thirty-five dollars for, he had small
sized fits, but waz warrented not tew hav more than three fits in enny
one da. I think this dog iz jist what yu are looking for; i offered
thirty-seven dollars for him, if the owner wud heave in a vial ov fits
medisin. He is tew giv me an anser tomorrow.</p>

<p class="ph4">ON WIDDERS.</p>


<p>Widders are an interesting studdy. Tha ma be dividid (tew anser our
purpis,) into 3 classes: <i>The Lone</i>, <i>The Grass</i>, and <i>The Star
Spangled Banner Widder</i>. The Lone Widder iz ginerally selebrated for
her piety, she haz passed the middle ov life, she knows she haz got
gra hairs in her hed, she will tell her age, and talks tenderla ov her
ded husband. Her grief iz sober, her weeds are rank, if she iz ritch,
she is charitable, if she is poor, she is humble. She seldum marrys
the sekund time. Her cheerfulness never bekums gayety, and her sorrow
never bekums lamentashun. If she has children, she treats them as the
partners ov her bereavment, if she has none, she bends down tew those
she meets as she wud tew the arly flower in her pathway. Her hole life
is a glora tew her sek, and an honour evra da tew him whose good memry
amung men she perpetuates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>The Grass Widder is marrid without enny husband. She keeps house
at a hotel, and kalls the servants bi familiar names. She sez that
her husband is a kurnel in the armee. Her thesis is unkongenial
tempraments, she kan repeat Don Juan, and hides Boccassio's tales under
her pillow. If she wud ride out she orders a coach, and a gentleman; if
she is ritch, she is arrogant, if she is poor, she is brasen. She kalls
virtue prudery, and sez she wouldn't swop chastity with Dianner. If her
kurnel is fortunate enuff tew git shot in battle, yu ma meet her and
hiz Lutenant at Nuport nex summer, marrid&mdash;for the season.</p>

<p>The Star Spangled Widder iz yung, ornamental, and&mdash;a fule. She marrid
her husband bekauze hiz name waz Alphonzo, and she mourns for him in
at least 50 feet ov krape. Her fingers are as jewelled as the hilt ov
a Spanish dagger. She was eddikated at a fust klass seminare, with a 9
months' vakashun in it evry year, and talks awl the languages, excep
english, bravely. She gases on you from beneath her limber eyelashes,
as pensiv as a wel fed kitten. Yu ma think she wants tew marry, but she
thinks she onla wants a friend. If she shud snare some old feller, with
a full puss, she wil make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> him a good toddy stik for his beverage. She
has more chastity than sens, and more vartue than affeckshun.</p>

<p>Upon refleckshun i am disposed tew sa that there iz no condishun that
a woman iz kalled upon tew fill so delikate, and so diffikult, as the
widder; a condishun in which the lovlaness ov their naturs kan be made
tew challenge our respek and admirashun, az alzo, a condishun in which
their frailties may exsite our abhorrense, and their weakness, our
disguss&mdash;Amen!</p>

<p class="ph4">ON COURTING.</p>


<p>Courting is a luxury, it is sallad, it is ise water, it is a beveridge,
it is the pla spell ov the soul. The man who has never courted haz
lived in vain; he haz bin a blind man amung landskapes and waterskapes;
he has bin a deff man in the land ov hand orgins, and by the side ov
murmuring canals. Courting iz like 2 little springs ov soft water that
steal out from under a rock at the fut ov a mountain and run down the
hill side by side singing and dansing and spatering each uther, eddying
and frothing and kaskading, now hiding under bank, now full ov sun and
now full ov shadder, till bimeby tha jine and then tha go slow. I am in
faver ov long courting; it gives the parties a chance to find out each
uther's trump kards, it iz good exercise, and is jist as innersent as 2
merino lambs. Courting iz like strawberries and cream, wants tew be did
slow, then yu git the flaver.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> I hav saw folks git ackquainted, fall in
luv, git marrid, settel down and git tew wurk, in 3 weeks from date.
This is jist the wa sum folks larn a trade, and akounts for the grate
number ov almitey mean mechanicks, we hav and the poor jobs tha turn
out.</p>

<p>Perhaps it iz best i shud state sum good advise tew yung men, who are
about tew court with a final view to matrimony, az it waz. In the fust
plase, yung man, yu want tew git yure systen awl rite, and then find a
yung woman who iz willing tew be courted on the square. The nex thing
is tew find out how old she is, which yu kan dew bi asking her and she
will sa that she is 19 years old, and this yu will find won't be far
from out ov the wa. The nex best thing iz tew begin moderate; say onse
evry nite in the week for the fust six months, increasing the dose as
the pasheint seems to require it. It is a fust rate wa tew court the
girl's mother a leetle on the start, for there iz one thing a woman
never despizes, and that iz, a leettle good courting, if it is dun
strikly on the square. After the fust year yu will begin to be well
ackquainted and will begin tew like the bizzness. Thare is one thing I
alwus advise, and that iz not to swop fotograffs oftener than onse in
10 daze, unless yu forgit how the gal looks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Okasionally yu want tew look sorry and draw in yure wind az tho yu had
pain, this will set the gal tew teazing yu tew find out what ails yu.
Evening meetings are a good thing tu tend, it will keep yure religgion
in tune; and then if the gal happens tew be thare, bi acksident, she
kan ask yu tew go hum with her.</p>

<p>Az a ginral thing i wouldn't brag on uther gals mutch when i waz
courting, it mite look az tho yu knu tew mutch. If yu will court 3
years in this wa, awl the time on the square, if yu don't sa it iz a
leettle the slikest time in yure life, yu kan git measured for a hat
at my expense, and pa for it. Don't court for munny, nor buty, nor
relashuns, theze things are jist about az onsartin as the kerosene ile
refining bissness, liabel tew git out ov repair and bust at enny minnit.</p>

<p>Court a gal for fun, for the luv yu bear her, for the vartue and
bissness thare is in her; court her for a wife and for a mother, court
her as yu wud court a farm&mdash;for the strength ov the sile and the
parfeckshun ov the title; court her as tho she want a fule, and yu a
nuther; court her in the kitchen, in the parlor, over the wash-tub,
and at the pianner; court this wa, yung man, and if yu don't git a
good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> wife and she don't git a good hustband, the falt won't be in the
courting.</p>

<p>Yung man, yu kan rely upon Josh Billings, and if yu kant make these
rules wurk jist send for him and he will sho yu how the thing is did,
and it shant kost yu a cent.</p>

<p>Piety iz a good kind ov dissease for a man tew hav, but when he has so

<p>Menny think tha luv their husbands almost tew deth, when in fack, tha
are only jealous ov them.</p>

shall git cheated out ov their respektability, while the codfish
familys are alwus nervous lest tha mite.</p>

<p>Good Lord, deliver us from the Falt finder, one ov yure kronick

tew pity them. Yure falt-finding old bachelor, for instanze, odars a
pair ov No. 8 boots, and then kolides with his shumaker insted ov his
big feet; he walks tew the depo tew saive hack-hire and misses the
trane, and then kolides with the time-table; he kourts a gal till she
has tew marry sumboddy else tew keep from spileing, and then he don't
believe thare is a vartuous woman living. If he enjoys ennything he dus
it under protess, and if ennyboddy else enjoys ennything he knows tha
lie about it. He is like a seckund rate bull tarrier, alwus a fiteing,
and alwus gitting licked. These kind ov critters never are reddy tew
die, bekause tha haint never begun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> tew live. I never maik their
ackquaintanse enny more than i dew sumboddy's small pox, bekause i am a
looking after bright things and haint got enny to lose. Thare aint enny
remedee for this dissease but hunger, and that aint parmanent unless it
results in starvashun. Good Lord, deliver us from the falt-finder! if
yu undertake tew argy with them yu onla flatter them, and if yu jine in
with them yu onla maik them mad with themselfs.</p>

<p>I had rather be a target for awl the bad luk in this wurld than tew
go thru life shuteing a pizen arrow at awl the good luk. The more i
think ov it, the more i keep thinking that falt-finding iz verry much
like bobing for eels with a raw potater; a fust rate wa tew git out ov

<p class="ph4">ON SNAIKS AND MUDTURKLES.</p>


<p>I divide snaiks into one class, to wit, the devilish:</p>

<p>They are ov much antiquity, having appeared about the same time that
Adam did. The exact purpis for which tha was built hain't been explored
yet; but one thing is sartin, tha are quite slippery and eazy to bend.
Tha travel on thair bellys, and go down hill the moste eazyest; this is
owing tew the fack that tha hain't got enny good rigging tew hold back
with.</p>

<p>Snaix have but few warm friends, altho thare is folks who flatter them;
sich persons ought tew be obliged to ware a pair ov them for a cravat.
Thare is but one thing that makes me more horrible than a striped
snaik, and that is a big black one jest sliding away from the place
whare I was going tew sit down on the grass.</p>

<p>We are told that Eve waz sedused bi a snaik, i don' beleave thare is
a woman living now, in theze parts, that it could be did tew without
spileing the snaik. I hav bin in the habit, ov late years, ov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> sedusing
snaiks miself evvry chanse i could git; i ginerally dew it bi gitting
them tew put their heds under a stone, and then i cruelly desert them;
sich is life.</p>

<p>Snaiks are amphibicus and thoze which dwell in the water are called
eels. Tha are ov awl cullers, and sum are pizen tew behold; amung theze
are the koperheds, but tha never bite enny ov their own folks. Snaiks
hav got a big appertite, akordin tew their size; i hav saw them no
thicker than your finger, with 4 inches wide ov toad in them, tha stuck
out like 2 quarts ov milk that had got into a young pup bi acksident.</p>

<p>The largest snaik in the wurld iz kept at Newport, he iz owned bi the
landlords, he never haz bin shown tew but one person tew a time, and
then he is generally 110 feet long; thousands go thare tew see him
summers, and pay 3 dollars a da for board and 2 dollars a week tew the
servants for something tew eat.</p>

<p>I beleave a snaik never dies onla bi mistake, and never ventures out
mutch in the winter when the travling iz bad, and lays eggs like a
small hen, but don't set on them bekauze tha hain't got enny more heat
in their body than a ramrod haz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>Almoste evry humin being haz got a nateral appertite agin snaix, and
i will bet, if you shud put a striped snaik in a 10 aker lot, whare
there was 27 wimmin picking strawberries, and holler out, "striped
snaik! striped snaik!" evry woman would skream, and go to feeling rite
oph for the snaik. It is ced that snaik ile applied to the back ov a
man's neck, will cure him from lieing. This is wuth trieing, even if
it wont wurk, but mi individoal presentiment iz, that when the lieing
disease gits familiar with a man, deth alone will put an eend to his
sufferings. But I dont want it understood that I am agin snaik ile, for
this one reason if no other, the more snaik ile there is in the market,
the less snaiks.</p>


<p class="center">MUDTURKLES.</p>

<p>Mudturkles liv in a shell, which tha git verry mutch attached to.
Tha are not fond ov company, and seldom receive visitors in their
houses. Their food consists prinsipally of what they eat, which tha
find wharever tha kan git it. Their style iz haf land, and haf water,
and tha are at home on the banks or at the bottom ov a kanal. Tha
hav sum eggs, which tha lay in sum warm sand, and ginerally hav them
hatched out tew the halves. Tha belong tew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> class known az "close
korporashuns," and are a hard animil tew whip, bekause tha alwus fite
under cover. The mudturkle kant climb very well, and therefore seldum
iz found up a tree. Tha are verry tuff ov life, and will outlive an
injun rubber shoe, and don't seem tew gro old enny faster than a paving
stone duz. Tha kan be domestikated without enny trubble; awl yu hav
tew dew, iz tew put them into a barrel, and tha aint ap tew stray off
far. Mudturkles hav their faults, but tha won't lie, nor drink rum, nor
chaw terbacker, and tho tha cant trot as fast az sum hosses kan, thare
sure tew git tew whare tha go tew, and never brake down on the rode.
I take a deep interest in moste awl the animils, and particularly in
mudturkles, and i dew hope that the Legislature in their wisdum won't
pass a law "prohibiting enny more mudturkles." I regret tew hear,
that in sum parts ov the kuntry, the people are in the habit of using
mudturkles tew pitch quoits with, but I think this wants an affidavy
with a revenew stamp onto it.</p>

<p>In theze mi remarks about snaix and mudturkles i hav tried hard tew
tell the truth, but if i hav failed, it is owing tew the grate skasity
ov truth in theze days.</p>

was in the kolporter bisness. We met, and stopped smoltaneously, as
it war; we looked into each others phases, sarching as it war, for
a linamont, a oasus, that we nu, or had hearn tell of, but the trak
pedlar, and pill pedlar, had evidently met for the first time on
arth. The dela that was thus instituted, giv me a margin for a clus
communion with the kolporturs feturs, and stile of habiliment, and tru
to natur, tuk the chance&mdash;he was about 59 years old, was very lite in
the karkass, and wore his close very much as a methodis dus, and had
one of them kountenances that Moses was celebrated for. I felt at the
first site, that he wud do tu ti to. He komensed as follers:&mdash;"Wafarin
man, monament of sparin mersa, du yu feel as tho yu had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> enny intrest

spiritoal dross, and had yur soal a flutterin agin the ribbid prisin
bars of yur body, like a kaged song bird of heavin? If yu haint, read
and peroose this trak; the ile that it kontains, will permoate thru the
resesses of yur hart, like the quicksilver of luv, and lukrubrate the
loose roaling stuns, that ly in yur jordanick pathwa." As he cum to a
stop, he bent on tu me one of those meller looks, that a tom kat gives
tu the mouse, as it lays pantin afore him, with a skin full of broken
bones, and a reachin around, he pulled from his sadle bags, a trak of
four pages, and give it tu me, with (if I ma be aloud the expresshun)
a angelik tenderness, and as he did so, he karlessly tuk a look at my
hoss, who stood quietly in the harness, a restin wun of his hine fete.
I thanked him, and sed I wud peroose the trak, an hoped to find the
ile, and silver, he spoak of. Not tu be bete in generosity, I opened
the lid of mi waggin, and selekted a box of pills, with a full kount,
and arisin from mi sete, I kommenced as follers, "respected kolportur,
allou me tu disiprookate, by plasin at yur disposal a full kount box,
of the selebrated antydiluvion pills, begot by Josh Billings (late of
this tioga keounty,) who now stans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> befoor yu. These pills are friendla
tu the innards of enny man, are holy made of rootes, are as saif tu
take as a fotograph, and at the same time, are as thoro as a sarch
warrant, there ar 26 ov them in a box, an tha sel, with a ful size fax
similer of the author on the lid ov the box. He tuk the antydiluvions,
and summed up as follers, "docter Billings, the perfeshun which you hav
chose, is wone ov the most anshient as wel as wone of the most humain,
it speaks volumes in yur praze, and as i winde mi wa on errants of

from mi happer harte, that praps our auspicious meeting tu da ma bee
the menes of awakin in yu, a arnest kry what shal i du tu bee saved."
At the kloze ov this speach, i wud have bin willin tu bet a Box of
antydiluvions agin a 10 rowed papir of solid headed pins, that the
kolporter was nasty on a hoss swap, and i kum tu the konklusion that i
wud just feal of his stile in that wa. Pretendin tu hav just notised
his hoss i went inter fits over the diskivery, and soon found i had
struc a lead, for the star spangle bannor, never had at one time enny
more sed in its praze, than the kolporter let of in favor ov his old
hoss. Not edzack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>ly disposed tu swaller, without stirrin, all he sed,
i thout i wud look the kritter over, and; jumpin out ov my waggin,
fur that purpis, soon found out that the trak pedler was after Jonas,
insted of me. After i had got the full size of the sarkumstanses in the
kase, i kum tu one of the brisk konklusions that the Billings family
are subject tu, by hintin in oktave, "that the kolporter was a dam
hiperkrit, and his spavined hoss a dam old pelter." This suddint bust
of centiment on mi part, awoke the sleapin pieta of the trak pedlar,
and he at wunst tuk me tu do for swarin. After i had told him, that his
prain and my swarin, was oph of the same peace, an neather ov us ment
any thing we sed, we parted,&mdash;the kolporter to save soals, and swap
hosses, and Josh Billings tu sell, for 25 sents a box, the antidiluvion

ken be ced ov so few things in this wurld, that i thought noboddy would
git mad and call me a verry d&mdash;n fule, for sirkulating the pictur.
7&mdash;The artiss said I was hard tew take, and this pictur was a triumph
ov the art; he alzo added that some ware so eazy tew take that it was
actooally dangerous tew leave ennything in their reach. These reasons
must be mi excuse for sending yu my pictur; if it don't look as yu
expekted i did, jist let me kno, and i will have one taken that duz.

<p>I never kan eradicate holy from mi memry the sound ov the first gong I
ever herd&mdash;i was setting on the frunt stupe ov a tavern in the sitty
ov Bufferlo, pensively a smokin. The sun was a goin tu bed, and the
heavens fur and nere was blushing at the purformanse. The Eri kanall
with its goldin waters was on its windin wa tu albany, and i was
perusin the line botes, a flotin by, and thinkin ov Italy, (whare i
used tu live,) and her gondolers, and gallus wimmin. Mi entire sole
was, as it ware in a swet, i wanted tu climb, i felt grate, i aktually
grew. Thar ar things in this life tu big tu be trifled with, thar ar
times when a man brakes luce from hisself, when he sees speerits, when
he kan almost tuch the moon, and feels as tho he kud fill both hands
with the stars ov heavin and almost sware he was a bank president.
Thats what ailed me. But the korse ov tru luv never did run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> smoove,

dummer, dummer dum, ... with one tremenjis jump, i struck the senter
ov the side walk, with anuther i kleared the gutter and with anuther,
i stud in the middle ov the strets snorting like a injin poney, at a
band ov musik; i gazed in wilde dispare at the tavern stand, mi harte
swelled up as big as an out door oven, mi teeth were as luce as a
string ov prairy beads. I thout all the crokery in the tavern stand had
fell down, i thout ov fenomenoms, i thought ov gabrel and his horn. i
was just on the pint ov thinking ov sumthing else when the landlord
cum out to the frunt stupe ov the tavern stand holding by a string the
bottom ov an old brass kittle. He called me gentla with his hand i went
slola and sadla tu him, he calmed mi feres, he ced it was a gong; i saw

<p><i>Part Seckunt.</i>&mdash;Majer Spenser had leaf ov abscense from his regiment,
and was glad enuff, i tell yu, tew swap the pesky air ov the suthern
konfederasy for the brittle breth ov Nu England. He spent his time a
climeing the mountains ov his natiff land, and looking way down into
the hollers; he worryed the trouts as tha swum up and down hill in the
brooks, and he gethered penroyal for his good old Ma tu hang up in
the wood hous chamber, tew make arb tea ov next winter. Majer Spenser
had a brother who was a minister ov the gospil, and the Majer boarded
with him. One Sunda nite the minister and the Majer sot kommuning
together. The moon cum up out ov the East, as big as an old fashund
kart wheel (one ov the ox kind ov kart wheels, i mean,) the stars stuk
clean out ov the ski, and the air was filled with the musick ov the
cows a chawing their cuds in the distance. All natur la undisturbed.

society. He says they hav more religion, akordin to their populashun,
than tha kno what to dew with. They marry young and often. The

it iz genrally a hereafter of wimmin. They are fond ov amusements, sich
az pitching cents and sliding down hill.</p>

cold water for 12 months. If that didn't seem tew influense me, I
would issue proposals tew the lowest bidder to be fed for one year on
bran bred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> slippery elm tea. If that didn't seem tew influense
me, I would sell my house and lot, and invest the proceeds in pattent
medisin, and take the whole lot in rotashun. If that didn't seem tew
influense me, I would cum tew the konklusion that I had the water
brash, or some other thing, I didn't care which, and take a job ov
thrashing out wet rye for evry tenth bushel, and git&mdash;well.</p>

should reseave the proposal from your lover. It iz sumthing ov a trick

fly back suddin, like a bocky hoss, but yu ought tew take it kind,
looking down hill, with an expreshun, about half tickled and half

<p>It will probely fill you with an arnest solisitude for mi fate, az it
dus me with emoshuns of stupenjus grander, tu find miself at this grate
modern Siloam, this august whirlpool ov wine, wimmin and hosses; this
fairy sceen ov poetry, dreams, and natural fisick. Upon mi arival,
i took immegiate rooms at the tavern called the "<i>Union</i> now and
forever," and commensed at onst tu kreate a sensashun&mdash;"Dignatum hok
hanimum disisimo." This centiment is from the Chocktaw ov Raphael, and
is one ov mi faverite quotashuns.</p>

<p>The town is about haf full ov folks, menny of them hav been highly
renowned. I kould name them personaly by name, but this wud look like
affekshun in me, az tha hav alreddy sent in their kard, and begged the
privilege ov kalling on me, at mi moste soonest spare time. It will
be impossible for me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> my amiable friends, tu give yu ennything like
a well digested orashun, ov the eckstatick wonders that hover around
me, among which i am permitted tu menshun the pensiv modesta ov the
unmarried; the gushing rapture ov the married; the shadowy tenderness
ov the widders, and the universal fisick that fills up the pauzes.
Theze are subjecks which hav bin writ onto so much that all the good
things haz bin said.</p>

<p>It iz a source ov grate pride tu see so menny here from youre citty,
and what fills me with gratitude tu an overruling Providence, iz the
fac that their festiv naturs develop into such lovelyness here; thare
iz dekon L&mdash;&mdash;, and Elder P&mdash;&mdash;, for instanze, with whom i take a drink
evry time tha ask me. I think now that i shall remain here for sevral
years. I am allmost sorry i didn't bring mi jewelry trunk with me; i'll
bet i could hav sold a thousand Dollars worth a da, ov brest pins. It
iz a fust rate place here tu buy hosses cheap. i waz offered 2 carriage
hosses for onla 25 hundred dollars; i shud hav tuk them, but i couldn't
hire enny boddy tu take them hum for me. There iz a grate menny here

<p>Congriss Spring is lokated here; it tasts verry much like sumthing
or ruther, i kant tell which, and iz now generally admitted tu be
kartharticus. I am partiklar impressed with the moral centiment that
pervades things here. I am told a man wanted tu hire a room tu gamble
in with dominoze, but the authoritize immejiately burnt him in effigee.
Dimonds are trumps here, and menny good hands are held. Thare is no end
tu the number ov selebrated belles here. Thare is one that cums out
about 3 o'clock every day, that takes them all down. I allude now in
a kind ov burleskish wa tu the <i>dinner</i>-bell. But, after all, Solomon
gits mi time when he bust out in this fashun, "All is vanitee and

<p>I kan sell for eighteen hundred and thirty-nine dollars, a pallas,
a sweet and pensive retirement, lokated on the virgin banks ov the
Hudson, kontaining 85 acres. The land is luxuriously divided by
the hand of natur and art, into pastor and tillage, into plain and
deklivity, into stern abruptness, and the dallianse ov moss-tufted
medder; streams ov sparkling gladness, (thick with trout,) danse
through this wilderness ov buty, tew the low musik ov the kricket and
grasshopper. The evergreen sighs az the evening zephir flits through
its shadowy buzzum, and the aspen trembles like the luv-smitten harte
ov a damsell. Fruits ov the tropicks, in golden buty, melt on the bows,
and the bees go heavy and sweet from the fields to their garnering
hives. The manshun iz ov Parian marble, the porch iz a single diamond,
set with rubiz and the mother ov pearl; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> floors are ov rosewood,
and the ceilings are more butiful than the starry vault of heavin. Hot
and cold water bubbles and squirts in evry apartment, and nothing is
wanting that a poet could pra for, or art could portray. The stables
are worthy of the steeds ov Nimrod or the studs ov Akilles, and its
henery waz bilt expressly for the birds of paradice; while somber in
the distance, like the cave ov a hermit, glimpses are caught ov the
dorg-house. Here poets hav cum and warbled their laze&mdash;here skulptors
hav cut, here painters hav robbed the scene ov dreamy landskapes, and
here the philosopher diskovered the stun, which made him the alkimist
ov natur. Nex northward ov this thing ov buty, sleeps the residense
and domain ov the Duke John Smith; while southward, and nearer the
spice-breathing tropicks, may be seen the barronial villy ov Earl
Brown, and the Duchess, Widder Betsy Stevens. Walls ov primitiff rock,
laid in Roman cement, bound the estate, while upward and downward, the
eye catches far away, the magesta and slow grander ov the Hudson. As
the young morn hangs like a cutting ov silver from the blu brest ov the
ski, an angel may be seen each night dansing with golden tiptoes on the
green. (N. B. This angel goes with the place.)</p>

<p>Biagrams kan be seen at the offiss ov the broker. Terms flattering.
None but principals delt with. Title as pure as the breth ov a white
male infant, and possession given with the lark. For more full

<p>I don't kno when i hav bin filled so near up tew the brim with a fond

good old borough ov Billingsville, whither i had gone on a visit tew
git mi boots tapped. The wimmin had called a meetin' ov the fair sekts
tew take into konsiderashun the propriety ov not wareing enny more
clothes, that is, forrin bilt clothes. The meetin waz got into shape bi
kalling Mrs. Peleg Pewter tew the chair. The fust thing she did waz tew
create a silence, which she did after about 30 minnits, awl excep a fu
whispering, which she could not dry up.</p>

<p>The style ov the meetin' having bin sot up in big type bi the Mrs.
Peleg Pewter, she ced thare waz an opening, and no less than 4 wimmin
started for the opening at onst; but the president decided that Mrs.
Cynthee Coon waz about one neck ahed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> tharefore, waz entitled
tew the fust heat. She waz a woman about 14 hands hi, and wore wollen
stockings. She ced she waz for home manafakter and waz agin awl luxury
excep a nu shawl, and that she must hav. She ced she waz willing tew
giv up silk, but she must hav 1 more nu shawl if it bust her.</p>

<p>She ced she thought thare ought tew be sum diskriminashun between what
folks didn't want and what tha did, and for her part she was reddy tew
go her length or ennyboddy else's length agin the noshun that poor
people had ov hankering after imported goods.</p>

<p>Her speech lasted for about 2 hours, and was listened to with
breathless expense. When she sot down the wimmin gathered around her;
sum ov them held camphor tew her noze, sum ov them unhooked her dress,
and one ov them, more thoughtful than the rest, mixed up a gin sling,
which she struggled with for a minnit, and then ced it did her soul
good. A committee ov 3 ov the heavyest wimmin was appointed bi the
chair with power tew draw up a sett ov resolushuns which was reported
as follows:</p>

<p><i>Whereas</i>, resolved, that silks, and shawls, and so forth, are a luxury
from imported kuntrys, and we are down on them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, that we are down on silks and shawls.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, that we wont uze silks and shawls onla in case ov sickness.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, that the foregoing resolushuns be published 3 times a week
in the <i>Billingsville Weekly</i>, and that our husbands foot the bills or
we foot them&mdash;the bills.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, that we pledg ourselfs, our fortins, and our natiff land,
tew sustane the above sett ov resolushuns.</p>

<p>After taking a pinch ov snuff, and kissing awl around, the meeting
broke up tew meet "sine die" on the next Teusday.... Ov course no
male man was allowed at the meetin', but i receaved a koppa ov the
resolushuns the nex morning, accompanyed with mi respeks.</p>

besides being as harmless as the duv. Thare was but one pond in the
town, and that was used for babtizing by agreement, on wensday ov each
week, bi Gaffit, and on saturday bi Sturgiss. One wensday, as Gaffit
was engaged in marking his sheep, or in uther wurds, was bi the side ov
the little pond ov water adminstering the rite ov babtism tew a goodla
number, whom he had coaxed awa from the wiles ov the devil, Sturgiss
looked in upon the happy scene, with eys brimful ov luv. Amung the

whom he had convikted, and whom he expekted tew add tew his flok on the
cumming saturda. The nex da the two elders met, Sturgiss charged Gaffit
with the pious fraud he had detekted bi the side ov the little pond.
Gaffit's eyes puckered with delite, as he listened tew the charge,
then seezin the methodis elder bi the hand with an extra pucker in his
eye, whispered: "Brother Sturgiss, mi father larnt me when i was but a
little fisher-boy, tew string mi fish as fast as i ketched 'em."</p>

<p>I arrived here nite before last at arly kandle lite. Mi wife and 2
children ackompanyed me. The fust thing that i did was tu call for a
tavern; i got one immegiately, and took a room, from choice, in the
Seventh story, all the rooms above wer took. The tavern whare i stop,
is called the Union, one, and inseprable. The bar is stocked with the
choicest lickers. Thare must be 3 or 4 hundred black serviants here,
tha all wear white aporns, and hav their hair curled clos. The tavern
keeper rings a gong with a klub when the vittles is reddy, and then the
boarders march in; 'tis a moste effecting site! I havent et ennything
yet but briled chickens. I gess evry body here knows me, tha look at me
so. I kreated a sensashun yesterday after dinner, on the front stupe
ov the tavern, by calling a cullard servant tu pick mi teeth. I herd
one ov the ladys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> sa, "i was an English Lord, she had saw me at Nuport
laste seson." I shall sta here as long as i can injuce mi females tu
remain. This is the place where the congriss water cums from; tha dip
it up out ov a hole in the ground, with a roof over it, you can drink 4
or 5 tumblers ov it tu onst, without swallering; it tastes a good deal
like sumthing i never tasted before, and it operates on the inwards
for all the world, just like pills. It dus look so funny tu see 8 or 9
hundred mails, and femails, all taking fisick tu once; 'tis a pensiv

<p class="ph4">JOSH BILLINGS CORRESPONDS WITH A "HAIR OIL AND VEGETABLE BITTERS MAN".</p>


<p><i>Dear Doktor Hirsute</i>:&mdash;I reseaved a tin cup ov yure "Hair purswader,"
also a bottle ov yure "Salvashum Bitters", bi express, for which, I
express my thanks. The greenbak, which yu enklozed waz the kind ov
purswader that we ov the press fully understand. Yur hair greese, shall
hav a reglar gimnastik puff, jist az soon az i kan find a spare time.
I tried a little ov it on an old counter brush in my offiss, this
morning, and in 15 minnitts, the brussells grew az long az a hosses
tale, and i notis this afternoon, the hair begins tew cum up thru, on
bak ov the brush, 'tis really wonderful! 'tis almoste Eureka! I rubbed
a drop or two on the head ov mi cane, which haz bin bald for more than
5 years, and beggar me! if I don't hav to shave the cane handle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> evry
day, before I can walk out with it. I hav a verry favrite cat, she iz
one ov the Hambletonian breed ov cats, and altho she iz young, and
haint bin trained yet, she shows grate signs ov speed. I thought I
would just rob the corck ov the bottle on the floor, in the corner ov
the room whare the cat generally repozes. The consequents waz, sum ov
the "purswader" got onto the hair ov the cat's tale. When the cat aroze
from her slumbers she caught sight ov her tale, which had growed tew
an exalted size; taking one more look at the tale, she started, and bi
the good olde Mozes! sich running; across the yard! over the fence! up
wun side ov an apple tree! and down the other! out into the fields,
away! away! The laste i saw ov the cat, she waz pretty mutch awl tale.
I wouldn't hav took 10 dollars for the cat, with her old tale on her.
In a fu daze, i shall find a spare time, and then i shall write up, for
our paper sumthing pyroteknik, which will make the hair grow on the
head ov a number 2 mackrel, to read it.</p>

<p>Dear Doktor, the fact iz, "sum men are born grate, sum men git grate
after they are born, and sum men hav grateness hove upon them." Doctor,
you are awl 3 ov these men, in one. You are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> kind ov vegatable
trinity, sassyfrass, pokeroot, and elderberry. It waz a happee thought
in you, tew call your "Salvashun Bitters" a "vegatabel tonicks,"
although, old rye aint one ov the vegatabels, whiskee iz one ov the
tonicks. The peopel must hev tonicks, and the more vegatabels you kan
git into the gratest amount ov whiskee, the more the peopel will luv
you. Thare is nothing the christian world long for so mutch, just
now, as a vegatabel bitter. Sassyfrass is good for a lonesum stummuk,
pokeroot is an alteratiff, and Elderberry was known to the anshients,
but what! oh tell me what! yee whispring winds, what! are awl these
without whiskee. Thank the Lord, that at laste, we hav got a bitter,
that will tonick a man up. Nothing, sinze the good old daze ov Jamaka
Rum, and sider Brandee, haz sent sich a thrill ov joy thru the wurld,
az "Hirsute's Salvashun Bitters," sold respektably bi awl druggists,
far and near.</p>

<p>Go on Doktur, manafaktring, and selling, let the cod liver, and pattent
truss men, howl out in envy, let pills rant, and plasters rave, you hav
got what the wurld wants, and will have, and that iz, an erb bitter,
with a broad whiskee basis.</p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;Bizziness, Doctor, iz bizziness. The hi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> prise ov material,
and laber, haz put up puffs with us, but upon the reseipt ov 50
Dollars more, yu kan rely upon sumthing, in our weekly, that will send
"Salvashun, and Purswashun" whirling thru the land.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;Let me advize yu az a friend; if it iz indispensible necessary
tew cheat a little, in the manufakter ov the "Salvashun Bitters," let
it by awl means be in the rutes, dont lower the basis.</p>

<p class="ph4">ON LECTURES.</p>


<p class="author">
Dec. 9, 1864
</p>

<p>I take my pen in hand, to inform you, that i am in the Lekturing
bizzness. I have jined the army ov martyrs, and am having a healthy
time. I lektured laste nite, tew a flooded house. Had a revival, evry
fu minnits, it would hav did yu good, tew hear the people holler.
The way things look now, i think i shall be able tew retire from
private life, in a fu months, and keep 3 or 4 dogs, and a fish pond.
Yesterday, i reseaved a dunnin letter, from mi fashionable tailor, for
a coat, that has bin wore out, more than 2 years. I replied tew the
limited cuss, briefly, as follers: "Dear sur&mdash;Enklozed, pleze find 20
dollars&mdash;if yu can. Yures, sum, Josh Billings."</p>

<p>I thought i would try a tragik lektur at fust, but tragediz are gitting
so common, now a daze, that yu kan git them done, and warrented, for 25
dollars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> Mi Lektur is the normal comick, with an okasional effort tew
be witty.</p>

<p>I hope you are well, and hav a good appetight. Remember me kindly
tew Reub Fenton, when yu see him.&mdash;I also reseaved 2 letters bi to
daez male, which i will let yu answer for me; thru yure valuable
collums.&mdash;One ov them is from an individoal, who sines his name
"Hennery," and tuther is from a person bi the name ov "Mirakle."</p>

<p><i>Hennery</i>:&mdash;The best time tew sett a hen, is when the hen is reddy. I
kant tell you what the best breed is, but the shanghigh is the meanest.
It kosts as mutch tew board one, as it duz a stage hoss, and yu mite as
well undertake tew fat a fanning-mill, by running oats thru it. Thare
aint no proffitt in keeping a hen for his eggs, if he laze less than
one a day. Hens are very long lived, if they dont contrakt the thrut
disseaze,&mdash;thare is a grate menny goes tew pot, evry year, bi this
melankolly disseaze. I kant tell exactly how tew pick out a good hen,
but as a genral thing, the long-eared ones, are kounted the best. The
one-legged ones, i kno, are the lest ap tew skratch up the garden. Eggs
packed in equal parts ov salt, and lime water, with the other end down,
will keep from 30, or 40, years, if they are not dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>turbed. Fresh
beef-stake is good for hens; i serpoze 4 or 5 pounds a day, would be
awl a hen would need, at fust along. I shall be happee tew advise with
yu, at enny time, on the hen question, and&mdash;take it in egg.</p>

<p><i>Mirakle</i>:&mdash;Yu sa "yu kant understand the mirakle ov the whale, that
swallered Joner". I dont serpoze that Joner, nor the whale, ever fully
understood it themselfs. I hav thought that it was eazyer for the whale
tew swaller Joner, than it was for the outsiders, tew swaller the
mirakel. I kant tell yu what Joner did while in the whale's sosiety;
but i kno what a yankee would hav did, he would hav rigged a rudder
on the animal, and run him into port, and either klaimed the ile for
salvage, or sold out his chanse tew a petroleun grease company.</p>

<p class="ph4">LAUGHING.</p>


<p>Laughing is strikly an amuzement, altho some folks make a bizzness ov
it. It haz bin considered an index ov karakter, and thare iz sum, so
close at reasoning, that they say, they kan tell what a man had for
dinner, by seeing him laff. I never saw two laff alike. While thare are
some, who dont make enny noise, thare are sum, who dont make ennything
but noise; and sum agin, who hav musik in their laff, and others, who
laff just az a rat duz, who haz caught a steel trap, with his tale.
Thare is no mistake in the assershun, that it is a cumfert tew hear sum
laffs, that cum rompin out ov a man's mouth, just like a distrik school
ov yung girls, let out tew play. Then agin thare iz sum laffs, that
are az kold and meaningless az a yesterday's bukwheat pancake,&mdash;that
cum out ov the mouth twisted, and gritty, az a 2 inch auger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> drawed
out ov a hemlok board. One ov these kind ov laffs haz no more cumfert
in it than the&mdash;stummuk ake haz, and makes yu feel, when yu hear it,
az though yu waz being shaved bi a dull razer, without the benefit ov
soap, or klergy. Men who never laff may have good hearts, but they are
deep seated,&mdash;like sum springs, they hav their inlet and outlet from
below, and show no sparkling bubble on the brim. I don't like a gigler,
this kind ov laff iz like the dandylion, a feeble yeller, and not a bit
ov good smell about it. It iz true that enny kind ov a laff iz better
than none,&mdash;but giv me the laff that looks out ov a man's eyes fust,
to see if the coast is clear, then steals down into the dimple ov his
cheek, and rides in an eddy thare awhile, then waltzes a spell, at the
korners ov his mouth, like a thing ov life, then busts its bonds ov
buty, and fills the air for a moment with a shower ov silvery tongued
sparks,&mdash;then steals bak, with a smile, to its lair, in the harte, tew
watch agin for its prey,&mdash;this it is the kind ov laff that i luv, and
aint afrade</p>

black wax will be, hiz posterity have aul bin good stickers, sum ov
the best clothes-pins the world ever saw, cum from this familee....
I remember olde Buffaloo. He waz a sunsett pironeer; he started tew
discover, "out west," 40 years ago, hiz property was a wife, with the
side ake, 2 galls, just busting thru their clothes into womanhood,
2 boys, who kould kill a skunk at 3 paces, and dodge the smell, a
one-hoss wagging, a rifle, and a brass-kittle, he squat at Rock River,
in the Illinoise, for 6 months, and then moved on more westly, the
last that ware seen ov him, was the hind-board ov hiz wagging, just
doubling the top ov the rocky mountains.... And thare waz Beltrigging,
who fust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> diskovered the tempranse question, he had bin a suckcessful
rumdrinker, and seller for 36 years, and had retired with a pile, he
diskovered kold water one day, on the back side ov hiz farm, digging
out foxes; he lektured nex day, in a 7-day babtiss church, and told
his xperiense; he made 13 hundred dollars lekturing, and died 9 years
afterwards, in grate agony, having drank 4 drops ov french brandee, on
a lump ov brown sugar bi mistake. He begot Springwater, and Springwater
begot Rainwater, and Rainwater begot Dewdrop, and Dewdrop begot
Morning-Mist, awl ov them selebrated tempranse lekturers.... And there
waz Solomon Saw-dust, the author ov bran-bred, and nailrod-soup; he waz
a champion ov lite weights; he fit the dispepshee in aul its forms; he
lived for 18 months, at one heat, on the smell ov a red herring, and
gained 9 pounds in wind. He had menny admirers and immitaturs the moste
grate ov which was Wet Pack and Water Kure.... And there waz Mehitable
Saffron, the virgin-hero ov wimmins' rights; i herd her fust orashun,
in the town hall; she spoke without notes, at arms' length. She ced,
"woman had a destiny that man kouldn't fill for her, and az for her,
she could go it alone, she didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> want no he-creeter around her, she
had on a pair of kowhide pegged boots, and closed up bi holding hi in
the air, a pair ov corduroy breeches, which she swore bi the good olde
Mozes, waz awl enny man had to brag ov".... She waz the first pironeer
in the corduroy britches business, she died celibate, and haz had menny
followers amung her sexes, but none that had the jism she had.... And
then thare waz Old Perpetual; he got crazee at last, but not till he
had invented a pitch-pine dog, with a bass-wood tail, that would bark
and chase every wagging that cum along, clean down to the bridge over
bean kreek. He got out a patent for a sorrel horse, and a nu milch cow,
and lived till he was 90 years olde, and then died from a kold he had
caught, down seller, trieing tew make soft sope, out ov bull's liver.
On hiz grave stun waz these affekting paragraph: "State, and county
rights for sale, enquire ov &mdash;&mdash; the widder."</p>
